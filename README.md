# MusicApp
Implemented a simple Spotify with users who can create their own playlists and add songs. They are already three users registered: "jose", "ignacio" and "prashant" with passwords "jose", "ignacio" and "prashant" respectively. When registering a new user, the password will be stored as it is, without any encryption.
The project implements a user interface and logic necessary to manage, create, modify or delete a playlist, search for a song, create a user, add or remove a song from the playlist and play or pause a song.

## Add music 
- Create a folder called "Musica"
- Create two new folders in "Musica" called "Songs" and "Albums"

To add single songs (.wav), add them in the folder "Songs" previously created

To add an album, add a new folder with the album's name which contains the songs of the album in the folder "Albums" previously created
